astar.java USER MANUAL
================

1. Execute the program.

2. Enter 3 values of row, column, and possibility of being an obstacle(= rate of obstacles among entire nodes).

  row- int, column- int, possibility- double

  (ex) 10 20 0.23

3. Then a map (generated by random) appears.

  This map contains obstacles, a start point, a destination point and 4 boundary lines.

4. If you press "enter" key, then the map appears with its shortest path.
(If its shortest path does not exist, it prints "No Path Exists.")

5. Else if you press "1" key first and then press "enter" key, then the map appears with the intermediate result where the algorithm executed step by step.

  Whenever the intermediate result appeared, you can choose to press whether only "enter" key to show the entire result or "1" key + "enter" key to execute the algorithm step by step.

6. You can repeat 2 to 5 with different row, column, and possibility until you enter "quit" whenever a path-finding finished.

7. If you enter "quit" at 6, the program terminates.
